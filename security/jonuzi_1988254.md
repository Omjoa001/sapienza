The results of running the flawfinder command ```flawfinder ```` are shown in the pictures ate the bottom section of the document.
Your report (ONE file in pdf format called LastName_Matricola.pdf) should contain: 
FLAWFINDER
-	up to 3 lines stating the major strengths and weaknesses of the tool
-	a screenshot of the output of the tool for the fragment
-	an analysis of each warning (max 3 lines each) 
-	vulnerabilities, if any, not flagged by the tool
-	a corrected version of the fragment where all the vulnerabilities found have been removed, with a screenshot showing that the tool “has no complains” 


The main strengths of the flawfinder tool are its ease of use, the fast and effective code scanning, as well as helpful suggestions which will improve the security of a program. The main weaknesses are that is does not execute code and cannot work with logical flaws.

There is a total of 13 errors found, here categorized by, of the different flaws, starting with:
```
#Line 42
[4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).

This refers to the following code snippet:
strcpy(buffer, foo);

This is a typical error which allows for buffer overflow to happen due to a larger input buffer than the  size of the output buffer. 

```
```
#Line 56
[4] (format) fprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.

This refers to the following code snippet:
{   fprintf(stderr, message);}

```
```
#Line: 8,28,33
 [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be improperly restricted, leading to potential
  overflows or other issues (CWE-119!/CWE-120). Perform bounds checking, use
  functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than the
  maximum possible length.

8 refers to the following code snippet:
char dst[(strlen(src) + 1) * sizeof(char)];
28 refers to the following code snippet:
char buffer[1024];
33 refers to the following code snippet:
char errormsg[1044]; 



```
#Line: 35
[2] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused). Risk is low because the
  source is a constant string.

This refers to the following code snippet:
strcat(errormsg, " is not  a valid ID");

```
#Line: 8,9,10
[1] (buffer) strlen: Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated; if given one it may
  perform an over-read (it could cause a crash if unprotected) (CWE-126).

8, 9 and 10 refer to the following code snippet:
char dst[(strlen(src) + 1) * sizeof(char)];
strncpy(dst, src, strlen(src) + sizeof(char));
dst[strlen(dst)] = 0;

```
__#Line: 9, 34__

\[1] (buffer) strncpy: Easily used incorrectly; doesn't always \0-terminate or check for invalid
  pointers \[MS-banned] (CWE-120).__

9 refers to the following code snippet:
```strncpy(dst, src, strlen(src) + sizeof(char));```
34 refers to the following code snippet:
```strncpy(errormsg, buffer,1024);```

```
#Line: 17,22
 [1] (buffer) read:
  Check buffer boundaries if used in a loop including recursive loops
  (CWE-120, CWE-20).

17 refers to the following code snippet:
read(fd, &len, sizeof(len));
22 refers to the following code snippet:
read(fd, buf, len); 

```
```
```
